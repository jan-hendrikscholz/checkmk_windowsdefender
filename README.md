# checkmk_windowsdefender
Checkmk 2.4 plugin to monitor Windows Defender on Windows and Linux (THX [@mattihautameki](https://github.com/mattihautameki)! üòç)

This is basically a port of the plugin, created by [@kevintijssen](https://github.com/kevintijssen/check_mk/tree/master/Windows/Defender) to CheckMK 2.4.

Migration to the new Checkmk developer API (shipping with 2.3 and the only way with 2.4+) has been performed by [@rseltmann](https://github.com/rseltmann) from Checkmk. :heart:\
This was done during the dev hour to showcase the necessary changes to extensions for ensuring 2.4+ compatibility.\

Version 1.2 is the first version only compatible with Checkmk 2.3 or later!
